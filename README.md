# PathFinders
Generate suitable running routes based on user preferences, customized to individual users

Current Progress:
- BackEnd has the basic logic for frontend to use. 
- Should have the process of taking in input, giving an output on terminal and handling errors
- Further logic that depends on routing API will be added later

LMK if there are any unexpected errors!
